# 🧶 SQL JOIN Scarf Project – From Yarn to SQL

This playful project turns complex SQL JOIN concepts into wearable fiber art. Each scarf visualizes a different JOIN type using stripes, colorwork, and intentional "NULL" glitches.

## 📚 JOIN Types Illustrated
- INNER JOIN: Only overlap colors where values match
- LEFT JOIN: Base color (Table A) flows; other (B) appears on match
- RIGHT JOIN: Reverse of LEFT JOIN
- FULL OUTER JOIN: Random striping, NULLs as dropped stitches

## 🧵 Sample Stitch Names
- `matchRow` – INNER JOIN block
- `leftJoinLoop` – Left matching pattern
- `rightAsRows` – Right matching
- `unionWrap` – Full outer randomness
- `nullKnit` – NULLs as dropped stitches

## 🛠️ Tools
- Yarn: 2 contrasting colors per scarf
- Knitting needles or crochet hook
- Optional: Embroidery or fabric pen for SQL taglines

## 💡 Idea by Nimisha Vernekar  
Inspired by combining fiber arts with data engineering principles.
